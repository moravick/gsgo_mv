# GEM-STEP Foundation

This is our new monorepo for managing all the related packages for GEM-STEP, managed with lerna/npm. It is under active development in a very early stage.

## Read the Wiki

Please read the [WIKI](https://gitlab.com/stepsys/gem-step/gsgo/-/wikis/Home) for current project status and general instructions.

## First Time Installation

If you have not installed the development tools required to run the project, you'll have to do this once. Follow the guide in [`docs/20-tooling/20-dev-install.md`](docs/20-tooling/20-dev-install.md). 

Currently we support MacOS Mojave or later, with plans to test on Linux.

## Running the System

After you've installed the development environment, follow the guide in [`docs/20-tooling/20-dev-running.md`](docs/20-tooling/20-dev-running.md).

This guide covers running, updating, and switching different development branches.
