# 4. Documentation Cleanup

Reducing documentation verbosity in main dev log, summarizing information, ahead of getting into more systems-oriented work mocking-up the entire system.

## Apr 13.01 - Checking Documentation

Is it on [GEM-STEP Foundation](https://gitlab.com/stepsys/gem-step/gsgo) home page? No. The readme needs updating.

## Apr 14.01 - Checking Docs Part II

Didn't get anything done on Tuesday. Working today on finalizing things to do. I think I'm done with documentation for now and need to switch to something more exciting. But first I'll update:

* [x] clean up this 00-dev-log 
* [x] test pull request
* [x] bump version on test success
* [x] accept

## Apr 16.01 - Inserting Markdown

The MEME project uses `react-markdown`, and its docs don't really list all the options. After perusing the source code I have a better sense of how it accomplishes what it does, and can infer that the syntax I expected will work.

## Apr 17.01 - Page Layout Classes

Laid out the tabbed interface using the page-level components. Made subpage components to allow much easier subdivision.
