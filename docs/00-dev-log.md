**SUMMARY S12 JUN 08-JUN 21**

* W1: Agent simulation execution engine starts. Basic agent set/get, value types, condition types, phasemachine
* W2: Agent collections, featurepacks, filters, and event+phase management started

**SUMMARY S13 JUN 22-JUL 05**

* W1: features,agents,phases. gsgo clone repo. agent, agentset, event, pm module_init. agent template functions. agent and features into factories, composition. agent API and event forwarding. Conditions class design and message within workflow. test function encoding. 
* W2:  condition class engine, simulation-data consolidations. program+stack machine research

**SUMMARY S14 JUL 06-JUL 19**

* W1: document [architecture](https://whimsical.com/Hd6ztovsXEV4DGZeja1BTB) so I can design [script engine](https://whimsical.com/N9br22U6RWCJAqSiNEHkGG).
* W2: capture activity [interactive intents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_z_fw7Lp0qwFL_wPGhRSvNs4DiLxf0yoGR6JFmZdpA/edit) and define [stack machine opcodes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jLPHsRAsP65oHNrtxJOpEgP6zbS1xERLEz9B0SC5CTo/edit#gid=934723724).

**SUMMARY S15 JUL 20-AUG 02**

* W1: opcode design, agent-script interaction design, diagram entire system
* W2: refactor to match system model, implement opcode/function execution engine, simplify system

**SUMMARY S16 AUG 03-AUG 16**

* W1: Added last pieces of script engine: condition objects, agent sets, tests, execution of subprograms.
* W2: Update [script engine docs+diagrams](https://gitlab.com/stepsys/gem-step/gsgo/-/merge_requests/9) as it stands now. Push repo. New wireframe based on Joshua diagram.

## S17 W1

With the scripting engine implemented, it is time to turn our attention to UX/UI. There has not been a lot of work on it since I started the script engine, so we are still starting from scratch. I am building out a sacrificial wireframe, based on Joshua's work!
