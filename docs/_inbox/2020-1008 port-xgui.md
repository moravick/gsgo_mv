next steps:
intent: just get xgui running standalone inside app_srv
* [X] make a new route for xgui in app_srv
* [X] mount the <App> defined in xgui
* [ ] skip adding scss to build chain for now

next:
* [X] commit changes

next:
integrate src-xgui into app_srv for now so we have one codebase
* [X] load ursys in App
* [X] add required URSYS start in App componentDidMount
      call UR.SystemConfig()
* [X] try to load the renderer?
      add div with rendererId in ModelPanel
      load the module
      copy the FULL displaylist hook from Tracker
      initialize RENDER in App.componentDidMount
--- renderer disappears if it's in ModelPanel, because React unmounts it
--- STOP WITH THIS and GET LUNCH
* [F] can we attach/detach renderer?
      not really because DIV dimensions are unreliable because React deferred render
      also need to figure out if reattach works or not...doesn't seem to with PIXI
* [X] try to load the simulator?
      look at generator, copy stuff over...bypass HCON stuff
      runs the same hardcoded thingy
---
* [ ] can we jam everything into the default CSSGRID???
      copy the grid over to a copy of xgui's home page
